Executive
 
Summary
 
The
 
Resume
 
Screening
 
&
 
Generation
 
Platform
 
is
 
an
 
AI-powered
 
tool
 
that
 
helps
 
both
 
job
 
seekers
 
and
 
recruiters
 
assess
 
the
 
fit
 
of
 
a
 
resume
 
for
 
a
 
given
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
software
 
product
 
and
 
services
 
industry
.
 
Users
 
can
 
upload
 
a
 
resume
 
(PDF/DOCX)
 
or
 
authorize
 
LinkedIn
 
profile
 
import.
 
The
 
system
 
uses
 
Gemini
 
2.0
 
to
 
parse,
 
evaluate,
 
score,
 
and
 
suggest
 
improvements.
 
It
 
then
 
optionally
 
generates
 
a
 
polished,
 
ATS-friendly
 
resume
 
using
 
one
 
of
 
five
 
modern
 
templates
 
—
 
exported
 
as
 
a
 
watermarked
 
PDF
 
(“Generated
 
using
 
nayaneshgupte.com”)
.
 
This
 
product
 
aims
 
to
 
bring
 
transparency,
 
consistency,
 
and
 
speed
 
to
 
resume
 
evaluation,
 
while
 
giving
 
job
 
seekers
 
high-quality,
 
personalized
 
feedback
 
that
 
actually
 
helps
 
them
 
land
 
interviews.

Problem
 
Statement
 
Today’s
 
resume
 
screening
 
process
 
suffers
 
from
 
three
 
major
 
issues:
 
(1)
 
Job
 
seekers
 
don’t
 
know
 
how
 
well
 
their
 
resume
 
matches
 
a
 
role
 
They
 
apply
 
blindly
 
and
 
make
 
changes
 
based
 
on
 
guesswork.
 
Most
 
cannot
 
benchmark
 
their
 
skills,
 
seniority,
 
or
 
experience
 
strength
 
reliably.
 
(2)
 
Recruiters
 
drown
 
in
 
manual
 
screening
 
Recruiters
 
in
 
software
 
companies
 
deal
 
with
 
hundreds
 
of
 
resumes
 
per
 
role.
 
Manual
 
scanning
 
for
 
relevant
 
skills,
 
experience
 
depth,
 
and
 
keywords
 
consumes
 
60–70%
 
of
 
hiring
 
time.
 
(3)
 
Resume-building
 
tools
 
are
 
generic
 
and
 
lack
 
role
 
alignment
 
Existing
 
resume
 
builders
 
provide
 
templates
 
but
 
do
 
not:
 
●
 
Assess
 
resume
 
vs
 
job
 
role
 
 
 ●
 
Score
 
skills
 
or
 
keyword
 
alignment
 
 
●
 
Provide
 
actionable
 
insights
 
powered
 
by
 
real
 
LLM
 
reasoning
 
 
There’s
 
a
 
clear
 
gap
 
for
 
a
 
tool
 
that
 
combines
 
screening
 
+
 
scoring
 
+
 
improvements
 
+
 
tailored
 
resume
 
generation
 
—
 
all
 
in
 
one
 
workflow.

Product
 
Vision
 
“Create
 
a
 
simple,
 
intelligent
 
assistant
 
that
 
evaluates
 
a
 
resume
 
like
 
a
 
top
 
recruiter
 
and
 
rewrites
 
it
 
like
 
a
 
world-class
 
career
 
coach.”
 
The
 
vision
 
is
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
most
 
accurate,
 
AI-first
 
resume
 
screening
 
and
 
generation
 
platform
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
software
 
product/services
 
world.
 
This
 
platform
 
should:
 
●
 
Understand
 
job
 
roles
 
deeply
 
(Product
 
Manager,
 
SDE,
 
QA,
 
DevOps,
 
Data
 
Scientist,
 
etc.)
 
 
●
 
Benchmark
 
skills
 
and
 
experience
 
realistically
 
 
●
 
Provide
 
transparent
 
scoring
 
(100-point
 
scale
 
with
 
category
 
weights)
 
 
●
 
Suggest
 
actionable
 
improvements,
 
not
 
generic
 
tips
 
 
●
 
Generate
 
ATS-proof
 
resumes
 
instantly
 
 
●
 
Work
 
with
 
both
 
uploaded
 
resumes
 
AND
 
LinkedIn
 
data
 
 
●
 
Never
 
store
 
user
 
data
 
permanently
 
(privacy
 
first)
 
 
Ultimately,
 
the
 
user
 
should
 
feel:
 
 
“This
 
tool
 
not
 
only
 
tells
 
me
 
my
 
score
 
—
 
it
 
tells
 
me
 
exactly
 
what
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
do
 
to
 
improve.”

deep
 
reasoning
 
is
 
perfect
 
for
 
nuanced
 
career
 
evaluation

●
 
Product
 
impact
 
 
●
 
Skill

●
 
Industry-specific

(c)
 
Huge
 
audience
 
value
 
●
 
Job
 
seekers
 
want
 
higher
 
interview
 
conversion.
 
 
●
 
Recruiters
 
want
 
time
 
saved
 
and
 
better
 
candidate
 
matching.
 
 
●
 
Career
 
coaches
 
want
 
a
 
tool
 
for
 
guided
 
consultation.
 
 
(d)
 
Resume
 
generation
 
is
 
a
 
natural
 
upsell
 
path
 
Once
 
users
 
see
 
their
 
score
 
+
 
improvement
 
tips,
 
they
 
are
 
highly
 
motivated
 
to
 
create
 
a

with
 
12+
 
years
 
experience
 
hiring
 
for

You
 
analyze

with
 
deep
 
reasoning,
 
evaluate
 
skill
 
depth,
 
detect
 
seniority
 
 
signals,
 
and
 
benchmark
 
candidates
 
against
 
target
 
roles.
 
Follow

never

How
 
Auto-Adjustment
 
Works
 
Gemini
 
adjusts
 
internal
 
logic
 
per
 
role
 
—
 
not
 
the
 
weights.
 
Example:
 
 
A
 
PM
 
role
 
may
 
emphasize
 
communication
 
&
 
ownership,
 
while
 
an
 
SDE
 
role
 
emphasizes
 
coding
 
depth.
 
Weights
 
stay
 
the
 
same;
 
scoring
 
rationale
 
changes

 1.

know:
 
 
“What’s
 
the
 
next
 
step?”
 
2.
 
Trust
